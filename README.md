# Lung Cancer Imaging Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an advanced analysis of lung cancer imaging data using unsupervised learning techniques. The primary objective is to identify intrinsic groupings within the dataset that may correlate with various stages or types of lung cancer. Through comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and model selection, we aim to provide insights that could potentially enhance diagnostic processes and treatment strategies for lung cancer patients.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 475 lung cancer images sourced from a public medical image repository. These images vary in size and color and represent a diverse range of cases, from early to advanced stages of cancer. The dataset is stored in the `data` directory, with each image appropriately labeled and organized for analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

Prior to analysis, extensive preprocessing steps were applied to standardize the dataset:
- Conversion to grayscale: All images were converted to grayscale to remove color variations and simplify feature extraction.
- Resizing: Each image was resized to a uniform size of 512x512 pixels to ensure consistency across the dataset.
- Normalization: Pixel values were normalized to a range of 0-1 to facilitate model convergence and stability.
- Feature extraction: Images were flattened into vectors, resulting in a high-dimensional feature space for analysis.

## Unsupervised Learning Models

Three unsupervised learning models were trained and evaluated on the preprocessed dataset:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Used for dimensionality reduction to retain 95% of the variance while reducing the feature space.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Employed to identify clusters based on density, with adjustable parameters for epsilon and minimum samples.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Applied to discern hierarchical groupings of data points using Ward's method, providing insights into the underlying structure of the data.

## Model Selection and Evaluation

Model selection was based on performance metrics, interpretability, and scalability. DBSCAN emerged as the most suitable model for this analysis due to its ability to handle the complexity of medical imaging data and effectively identify distinct clusters and outliers. The efficacy of each model was assessed using silhouette scores, cluster visualization, and domain expertise validation.

## Key Insights

DBSCAN revealed three significant clusters within the dataset, with potential correlations to different stages or types of lung cancer. Outliers identified by DBSCAN may represent rare or atypical cases warranting further investigation. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying patterns and heterogeneity of lung cancer imaging data.

## Future Directions

Future research directions include:
- Integration of patient metadata to contextualize clusters and validate clinical findings.
- Exploration of supervised learning techniques for predictive modeling, leveraging identified clusters as labels.
- Fine-tuning of DBSCAN parameters to optimize clustering granularity and enhance interpretability.
